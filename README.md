# Stone-Paper-scissor-Game
The *Stone, Paper, Scissor Game* is a C program where the player competes against the computer for five rounds. Using `rand()` and `srand(time(NULL))`, the computer makes random choices. The program uses `if-else` statements to decide winners, updates scores after each round, and finally declares the overall winner or a draw.
